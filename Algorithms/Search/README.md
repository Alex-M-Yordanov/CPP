## Linear Search

 * Time Complexity: O(n)
   
 * Memory Complexity: O(1)


## Binary Search

 * Time Complexity: O(log n)
   
 * Memory Complexity: O(1)

   > Note: Binary Search works with sorted arrays.

## BFS

 #### Usage:
        Finding the shortest path between 2 edges.
        Locating a cycle.

 ##### Trees:
 * Time Complexity: O(V)
   
 * Memory Complexity: O(V)
   
   >Note: V is the number of nodes in the tree.

##### Graphs:
  
        
 * Time Complexity: O(V+E)
   
 * Memory Complexity: O(V+E)
   
   >Note: V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
   >Note: Used for unweighted and undirected graphs.
