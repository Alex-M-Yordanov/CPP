## Linear Search

 * Time Complexity: O(n)
   
 * Memory Complexity: O(1)


## Binary Search

 * Time Complexity: O(log n)
   
 * Memory Complexity: O(1)

   > Note: Binary Search works with sorted arrays.

## BFS

 ##### Trees:
 * Time Complexity: O(V)
   
 * Memory Complexity: O(V)
   >Note: V is the number of nodes in the tree.
